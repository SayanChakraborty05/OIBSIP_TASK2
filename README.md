## Unemployment Analysis using Python

### Unemployment Analysis for the year of 2020 is done when due to Covid-19 the unemployment rate grew and then subsequently it slowed when the Covid-19 decimated. I have used many graphs to analyse and help in visualizing the unemployment and impact of Covid-19 on the employment rate of India and made a comparison on the employment ratebefore and after lockdown that was implemented during Covid-19. THe states that were least impacted and those that are worst impacted are shown in the analysis.
